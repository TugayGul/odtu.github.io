- title: "A Rare-Earth Free Magnetically Geared Generator for Direct-Drive Wind Turbines"
  image: 17.jpg
  description: A novel Vernier type magnetically geared direct-drive generator for large wind turbines is introduced in this paper. Conventional Vernier-type machines and most of the direct-drive wind turbine generators use excessive amount of permanent magnet, which increases the overall cost and makes the manufacturing process challenging.

  image: powertech2019.png
  description:  Considering that number of operational PV systems is very high, and occurrence of a malfunction is rare, use of automatic malfunction detection methods necessitates. This paper develops a method that detects any malfunction of a PV system. The malfunction may refer to failure of communication network, sensor malfunctions or data logging unit errors as well as problems of inverters and PV panels.

  description: The main aim of this study is to optimize an axial flux eddy current damper to be used in a specific aviation application. Eddy current dampers are more advantageous compared to conventional mechanical dampers as they are maintenance-free due to contactless structure and have higher reliability, which is very desirable in aerospace applications..

  image: 1.jpg
  description: LCL filters are widely used in distributed power-generation systems to attenuate high-frequency harmonics caused by pulse-width modulation switching of grid-connected inverters. A resonance occurs due to the series-connected reactive components. In order to damp resonance effects, active and passive damping methods are used.
