- title: Comparison of winding configurations in double-stator switched reluctance machines
  image: 11.png
  description: The double-stator configuration of the switched reluctance machine (SRM) aims to maximise the energy conversion efficiency by optimising the ratio of motional force to the total magnetic force. Maintaining the attractive features of SRM, the double-stator switched reluctance machine (DSSRM) proves to have higher torque/power density than the conventional SRM, which is a crucial feature for traction applications.

  image: 12.jfif
  description: This paper proposes a new design approach applied to optimal design of synchronous reluctance machines. The proposed technique removes all the conventional constraints posed by traditional designs of classic magnetic configurations and only keeps a minimum airgap length and shaft diameter as the boundary conditions.
